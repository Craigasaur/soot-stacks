# Soot

named for the impure carbon particles resulting from incomplete combustion, **Soot** is intended to provide a secure and reliable environment for personal services and function as demonstration of modern cloud-native architecture, networking, and devops practices.

## Architectural Pillars

- Zero-Trust Cloud-Native Networking: Tailscale Mesh VPN

all services are strictly internal

- Infrastructure as Code: Docker & Git

every component is defined using `Docker Compose` and version controlled via `Git`

intended to be portable, reproducible, and documented

- Traffic Management: AdguardHome & Ngingx

adblock service and dns mapping for internal navigation
